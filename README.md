# Excel-Project
An Excel project based on bike buyers in the US. Cleaning Data, Pivot Tables and Visualisations

In this project I cleaned the data using 'Remove Duplicates', I used the Trim function to make it easier to read as well as the Proper function.
I pulled the year out from the date to make it easier to use.

I used Pivot tables to gain valuable insights on the sales data and created a visualisation dashboard to show this data.
